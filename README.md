Honeywell Total Connect for Smartthings

This little project is a SmartThings (home automation) module for the Honeywell Total Connect (wifi thermostat) system.  It allows the user to, inside the SmartThings app, see current temp and set target temp.

My use of this hardware is limited to a single model and heating only so it may not work generally.  Also, it spoofs the web client in order to pull data and send commands as there is no proper API at the time I wrote this.  This is a fragile approach.
